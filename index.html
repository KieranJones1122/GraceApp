            <h2 class="title2">Why would I like to join this Team?</h2>
            <p>I'm really excited by the opportunity to join the Customer Support & Insight Team. Having worked for Sky for over six years, I have developed tonnes of knowledge and experience and have a passion for supporting customers. This role perfectly aligns with my skills and interests, and I am eager to contribute my expertise in providing insightful solutions and exceptional customer support. I have recently found myself interested in insight & analyst roles and have been looking for an opportunity like this. In my personal life, I have started to learn coding, which is the reason I'm submitting this application as a website.<br><br>

                Throughout my time at Sky, I have worked in many different roles and departments, including the Stockport Engagement Team, Role Modelling & currently the Employee Experience Committee. These experiences have allowed me to develop a keen sense of understanding when it comes to recognising trends and identifying areas of concern. Being part of the employee experience committee, we provide insight with the goal of making Sky a happy and inclusive place for all. We recently reviewed the trends from the People Survey, reviewing areas of concern and ways we can improve. One that stands out is staff feeling they don't get enough time with their managers. I feel this role will greatly help with improving that, with CEL's no longer having to manage the mail box, this frees up their time, providing opportunities to focus on building deeper personal connections and work on managerial projects and progression. I firmly believe that both customer & employee insights are invaluable for driving meaningful improvements and enhancing the overall customer and employee experience. I believe this role will do just that. It will not only positively impact customers but also employees.<br><br>
                
                In addition to my customer service expertise, I am highly adaptable and thrive in fast-paced environments. I am confident in my ability to work collaboratively with teams, sharing insights, and driving initiatives that benefit both customers and the company. What sets me apart is my genuine passion for customer satisfaction. I thrive on creating positive experiences for both my colleagues and customers. I am continuously seeking ways to improve processes, streamline workflows, and proactively address potential challenges. My dedication, passion, and experience make me a strong candidate for this role, and I am confident that I can contribute significantly to the teams success.</p>
